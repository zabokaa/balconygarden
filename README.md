## Deployment

  From How to Start a Django Project till Access to your Deployed Site:

1. **Start a Django Project:**
   Open your terminal (I am working wiht VS Code) and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run the command `django-admin startproject your_project_name`.

2. **Create a New Django App:**
   Navigate into your new project directory with `cd your_project_name` and run the command `python manage.py startapp your_app_name`.

3. **Create a Model:**
   In your new app directory, open the `models.py` file and define your model classes.

4. **Create a View:**
   In the same app directory, open the `views.py` file and define your view functions or classes.

5. **Update URLs:**
   Update the `urls.py` files in your project and app directories to route to your new views.

6. **Run Migrations:**
   Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to create and apply migrations for your new models.

7. **Test Your App Locally:**
   Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the development server and access your app in your web browser.

8. **Login to Heroku:**
   Run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials.

9. **Create a New Heroku App:**
   Navigate to Heroku and click on "New" > "Create new app". Enter the app name (e.g., "goodfood"), and click "Create app".

10. **Update Settings:**
    Update your `settings.py` file to be compatible with Heroku. This includes setting `DEBUG` to `False` (always before deploying with Heroku!), adding your Heroku app URL to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and configuring your database to use Neon Postgres.

11. **Back to Heroku Configure Environment Variables:**
   Navigate to "Settings" > "Config Vars" and click "Reveal Config Vars". Add a new variables with the keys for `SECRET_KEY`, for connecting to Database `DATABASE_URL`, and for storaging media files in a cloud aswell `CLOUDINARY_URL`

12. **Connect with GitHub:**
   Navigate to the "Deploy" section, connect with GitHub, and choose your repository name.

13. **Choose Deployment Method:**
   Decide if you want to deploy manually or enable automatic deployment after every commit to GitHub.

14. **Access Your Deployed Site:**
   Once done, your application will be live. Yippie!

15. **Access Your Deployed Site:**
    Once the build is successful, you can access your deployed site using the URL provided by Heroku.

16. **Clone and Install Dependencies:**
   If you want to clone this repository, you can easily install all necessary versions and libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
